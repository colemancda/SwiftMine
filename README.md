# SwiftMine 0.1
A Minecraft PE Server, written in Swift.

##Goal

This is an attempt at a mostly direct port of the PocketMine-MP Minecraft PE server software, into Swift, Apple's (relatively) new programming. Swift is currently available for Linux, and my hope is that some of this work may lead to interesting possibilities for iOS as well. The end goal is a complete implementation of a Minecraft PE server, including full redstone support (a rarity). All developers are welcome!

###Notes
This server is currently not operational. To do: Make operational
